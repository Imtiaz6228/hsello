    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Twitter. Or X, as it's called now. Whatever you call it, this platform's different. It's not about pretty pictures or long videos. It's about ideas. Conversations. Real talk in 280 characters or less.</p>

        <p>I remember when I first joined. Thought it was just celebrities complaining about airlines and people sharing memes. But then I saw how businesses were using it. How influencers were building empires. How one well-timed tweet could change everything.</p>

        <h2>Why Twitter Matters for Business</h2>
        <p>Look, everyone's on Instagram for the visuals, YouTube for the deep dives. Twitter? This is where decisions get made. Where conversations happen in real-time. Where you can actually influence what people think.</p>

        <p>CEOs tweet. Politicians tweet. Brands launch products. Journalists break news. And you? You can be part of that conversation. Build a following. Create opportunities you never dreamed of.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up Your Professional Presence</h2>

        <h3>The Handle Says It All</h3>
        <p>Your username is your brand. Make it simple, memorable, professional. @YourName is better than @CoolGuy123. If you're a business, use your actual business name if you can get it.</p>

        <p>And the bio? This is your elevator pitch. What do you do? Why should people care? Include keywords people might search for. Add your website. Make it count.</p>

        <h3>Profile Picture & Header</h3>
        <p>Don't use a selfie from 2012. Get a professional headshot. Smile. Look approachable. For businesses, use your logo but make sure it's clear and readable even when small.</p>

        <p>The header image? Use it to tell your story. Your product. Your mission. Make it visually striking but not overwhelming.</p>

        <h2>The Art of The Tweet</h2>

        <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
        <p>You don't need to tweet 50 times a day. Quality matters more than quantity. Say something worth reading. Add value. Make people think.</p>

        <p>But consistency is key. Be present. Show up regularly. Your audience needs to know you're there.</p>

        <h3>What Actually Gets Engagement</h3>
        <p>Questions work. "What's your biggest marketing challenge?" gets replies. Opinions spark debates. "I think email marketing is dead. Fight me." gets people talking.</p>

        <p>Stories work too. Share your journey. Your failures. Your wins. People connect with real experiences.</p>

        <h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>
        <p>When's your audience actually online? Check your analytics. For most businesses, mornings and evenings work best. Lunchtime too. Weekends? Depends on your niche.</p>

        <p>But don't overthink it. If you've got something timely to say, say it when it matters.</p>

        <h2>Building Your Network</h2>

        <h3>Who To Follow</h3>
        <p>Follow people who inspire you. Leaders in your industry. Potential customers. Journalists who cover your space. Don't just follow for followers – follow to learn.</p>

        <p>And engage. Reply to tweets. Quote interesting thoughts. Add value to conversations. People notice when you're genuine.</p>

        <h3>The Follower Quality vs Quantity Debate</h3>
        <p>Look, 10K engaged followers beat 100K bots any day. Focus on people who actually care about what you do. Who might buy from you. Who might collaborate with you.</p>

        <p>Grow organically. Force following people just to get followed back? That's the fast track to a ghost town.</p>

        <h2>Twitter for Business Growth</h2>

        <h3>Customer Service Goldmine</h3>
        <p>People complain on Twitter. Fast. And they expect fast responses. Turn complaints into opportunities. Show you care. Solve problems publicly.</p>

        <p>One company I know turned a angry customer tweet into their best case study. Responded quickly, fixed the issue, and the customer became a brand advocate.</p>

        <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
        <p>Twitter's great for finding potential customers. Search for keywords in your niche. Join conversations. Provide value first, then gently mention your solution.</p>

        <p>But don't be salesy. People can smell that from a mile away. Build relationships first.</p>

        <h3>Crisis Management</h3>
        <p>Bad news travels fast on Twitter. If something goes wrong, address it immediately. Be transparent. Show you're human. Most people will forgive mistakes if you own them.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Twitter Strategies</h2>

        <h3>Threads: The Long-Form Content</h3>
        <p>Got something complex to explain? Use threads. Break it down into digestible chunks. Number them. Add visuals. Threads get more engagement than single tweets.</p>

        <p>But keep them valuable. Don't just thread for the sake of it.</p>

        <h3>Lists: Organize Your World</h3>
        <p>Create private lists of competitors, industry leaders, journalists, potential partners. Stay informed without cluttering your main feed.</p>

        <h3>Spaces: Live Audio Conversations</h3>
        <p>Twitter's Clubhouse competitor. Host sessions, interviews, Q&A. Build deeper connections. But prepare well – live means unfiltered.</p>

        <h2>Analytics: Know What Works</h2>

        <p>Twitter gives you great insights. What tweets perform best? When do people engage most? Which topics resonate?</p>

        <p>Use this data. Double down on what works. Stop doing what doesn't. Simple as that.</p>

        <h2>Mistakes I See Too Often</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tweeting too much (or too little)</li>
            <li>Being too salesy</li>
            <li>Not engaging with others</li>
            <li>Ignoring negative feedback</li>
            <li>Using it as a broadcast channel only</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Twitter's Unique Power</h2>

        <p>Twitter moves fast. Ideas spread like wildfire. One good tweet can lead to opportunities you never expected – speaking gigs, partnerships, job offers, even book deals.</p>

        <p>But it's fragile too. One bad tweet can damage your reputation. Be thoughtful. Be authentic. Be consistent.</p>

        <p>This platform rewards the genuine. The helpful. The interesting. Be those things, and you'll build something special.</p>
